## Vulnerabilities & Security

Thank you for showing us where we need to harden; and, where to soften.

## Mindset

ad hoc init.
A/B Validation & Methodology Scrutiny
Curious Invesetigation of knowledge boundaries
Contemplative of "Cambrian" style combinatorial explosions & gaps (Always wondering "What are we missing").
UX Feedback & Quick Iteration loops -> Exploration & Set-Up of Built Environments
Customize Everything, not; but, Everything is Customizeable
Translingual (Cultural & Linguistic Arachaeology "Paradigm Preservations" & "Looking Glasses / Lenses")
Experimentation & Foundation
Build, Test, Validate; Converse, Disperse, Build, Test, Validate; Compare; Merge. Evolve.
Sometimes Constraints Create Imperatives
Which of the World's Problems can help be solved with the facilitation of knowledge, now?
How do we curate and package it?
Efficiency and Low User Friction Interfaces
