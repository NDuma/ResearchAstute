Research Astute Project Roadmap
===
This roadmap represents the current core development directions of the Research Astute project.

> The biggest single contribution users can help make to the project is by working on issues, bugs and features
that **are not necesarily related to this roadmap**. That is because you have a unique understanding of what is lacking in the project,
that would be great to hear. [See CONTRIBUTING.md for more information here](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Goals:
To create a unifying framework for discussion and curation on the web.
To feed stringent data into open projects
To contribute resources for the assistance of both aggregating and privatizing data 
To curate knowledge ecology maps and facilitate transaction
To model combinatorics, cohorts, persona's, and collaborative contexts to results driven A/B architecture first design.

## Immediate Considerations:
 - [ ] Chrome Extension
 - [ ] Web.Archive +UX revision checker

 - [ ] Create "Some Decision Document"
 - [ ] HUD Design Considerations
 - [ ] 1. Trail On/Off
     *     a. History + Tab / Link parent child relationship
     *     b. Group aggregation "Delphic Clustering"

  - [ ] 5. NLP Semantic Feature Extraction (Clustering & "Tag Cloud-ing")
  - [ ] 6. "Discussion Trial" - "Layered Nesting" [Neg / Aff weightings]
  - [ ] 7. OAuth + listeners
  - [ ] 8. Learn from "UserScripts"
          a. Map most popular libraries across existing platforms
            I. feature extraction for our purpose & identify existing competitors & collaborators
  - [ ] 9. Identify Data Repositories & Social Networks
          a. initialize data curation systems
            I. API's
            II. User private screen saving + Monitored
  - [ ] 10. Identity + Authorization Management
  - [ ] 11. Meritocratic Education
          a. YouTube Validation + Private / Integrated Comments
          b. EDx + MOOC integrations
          c. Syllabus & Course Comparison
  - [ ] 12. Deployment Framework's
          a. Curation of Crowdsourced Frameworks
          b. Chat integrations (Slack, Gitter, Rocket.im, Google, Skype, SMS, etc...)
            I. Agreements & "Binders"

          a. State-Machine
          b. "IOTA"
          c. See Decision Matrix
  - [ ] 14. Curate Selected Search Paths & Styles 
          a. as Users go through FCC to generate "Persona's" and filter best answer sources to context.
            I. Consider "Google Research" embedded overlay on Google Docs
              !! Most recent visit to FCC has Gitter Chat overlay on the right column !! 
              
## Think of World of Warcraft HUD's for Research
  
  ## Long Term Goals
   - [ ] Process the Universe
